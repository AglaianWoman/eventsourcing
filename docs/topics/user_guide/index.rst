This user guide describes how to write an event sourced application.

To create a working program, you can copy and paste the code snippets
from each section into a Python file. The code snippets in this section
are tested automatically. Please feel free to experiment by making variations.

If you are using a Python virtualenv, please check that your virtualenv
is activated before installing the library and running your program.
